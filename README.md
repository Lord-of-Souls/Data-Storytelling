# Data Storytelling: Analytical Insights & Visual Communication

## Description
This project focuses on **Data Storytelling**, the art of translating complex data analysis into compelling narratives. By combining rigorous hypothesis testing with intuitive visual design, this project bridges the gap between technical data science and executive decision-making.

## Project's Objective
The goal is to perform a comprehensive data analysis and use high-impact visualizations to communicate findings. The project concludes with a non-technical presentation designed to inform colleagues and stakeholders about key business conclusions.

## Results
- **Interactive Data Exploration:** Dynamic charts that allow for deep-dives into specific variables.
- **Executive Presentation:** A [PowerPoint](https://www.microsoft.com) deck that simplifies technical results into actionable business insights.
- **Evidence-Based Conclusions:** Clearly defined takeaways supported by statistical validation.

## Methodology
The workflow follows 2026's best practices in data communication:
1.  **Deep-Dive Analysis:** Performing data cleaning and exploratory analysis to find hidden patterns.
2.  **Hypothesis Testing:** Using statistical methods to ensure findings are mathematically sound.
3.  **Visualization Design:** Crafting intuitive, "glanceable" charts using Seaborn for static reports and Plotly for interactive exploration.
4.  **Storytelling:** Structure the findings into a narrative flow (Problem → Analysis → Solution) suitable for a general audience.

## Utilized Tools
- **Data Treatment:** [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org) & [NumPy](https://numpy.org).
- **Static Visuals:** [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org) (for polished, publication-ready charts).
- **Interactive Visuals:** [Plotly](https://plotly.com) (for dynamic, hoverable data graphs).
- **Communication:** [Microsoft PowerPoint](https://www.microsoft.com) (for the final stakeholder presentation).

## Acquired/Developed Abilities
- **Data Storytelling:** Ability to contextualize data within a business narrative.
- **Audience Adaptation:** Translating P-values and statistical jargon into "Plain English" for non-technical superiors.
- **Interactive Dashboarding:** Creating graphs that allow stakeholders to interact with the results.
- **Information Design:** Choosing the right chart type to maximize clarity and minimize cognitive load.

## Upgrades to be Made
- [ ] Integrate the [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) framework to host the presentation as a web app.
- [ ] Add an automated "Executive Summary" generator using NLP (Natural Language Processing).
- [ ] Enhance PowerPoint visuals with [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com) live data embeds.

## How to Run It
You can run the project files in two ways:

### Option 1: Google Colab
1. Upload the `.ipynb` files directly to [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com).
2. Run the cells sequentially.

### Option 2: Local Environment (VS Code)
1. Ensure you have [Python](https://www.python.orgdownloads/) installed.
2. Install the **Jupyter Extension** in VS Code.
3. Open the `.ipynb` file and select your Python interpreter.
